    <p>The demands of healthcare milieu from modern day nurses have increased manifold. Coordination of patient care, administration of treatment and responding professionally to critical care scenarios, the scope of responsibilities of nurses are on the rise, in response to the advancements in medical care. More than being assistants, nurses are expected to deliver exceptional care to their patients, which in turn requires honed nursing skills, effective communication, critical thinking, and precise clinical judgment, all of which begin to get shaped from the labs at nursing school.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Nursing labs are designed to allow students to practice skills and techniques in safe, controlled, and supervised mock clinical environments. In these labs, students can develop and hone their skills under professorial instruction. Using this model, when the time comes to apply their skills to real patients, students can do so with confidence.</p>
    <br>
    <p>At RSM, nursing labs focus on a wide range of nursing skills and knowledge, and the students are not restricted to only one piece of subject matter at any given time. Lab begins with a briefing, which includes the involvement of each student as well as the faculty, who will be administering the lab and overseeing student progress. Guided by these faculties, they can work with their fellow cohort members to apply what they have learned while under a certain level of pressure.</p>
