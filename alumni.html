        When I think of RSM School of Nursing, I remember with gratitude and love all my beloveds who introduced me to the nursing profession.  One of the most memorable aspects of my education at RSM was the opportunity I got, to work directly with patients during clinical rotations. Assisting and comforting patients in their most vulnerable moments, taught me something new about compassion, empathy, and the importance of human connection in healthcare. I embarked on my nursing career with a sense of purpose and determination strictly based on the values inculcated in me during those days. Nursing is a dynamic field, constantly evolving with new technologies, treatments, and challenges. As a lifelong learner, I have embraced opportunities for continuing education and professional development, eager to stay at the forefront of healthcare practices and advancements.

        I remember with gratitude the RSM family, those olden days which took me not alone through academics of nursing education but lessons for life too.<br><br>
        One of the most valuable lessons I learned at RSM was the power of empathy. The precise clinical trainings gave me opportunities to get aligned with the patients, experiencing their trauma and vulnerability which goes hand in hand with any ailment or injury. Here I learned, beyond the diagnosis or prognosis, to attend each patient with due respect and confidence. Those lessons are in me even today, guiding me while I interact with patients and their families.      </p>
